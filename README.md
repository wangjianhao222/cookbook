# 🍳 Online Cookbook Application

The **Online Cookbook Application** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) program that allows users to explore recipes from **[TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)**, an open online recipe database.  
By combining the **Tkinter GUI toolkit** with the **Requests library**, this project provides an intuitive and interactive way to search, browse, and view cooking instructions with ingredients neatly formatted.
